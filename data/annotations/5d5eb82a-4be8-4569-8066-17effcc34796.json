Hazard is most known for La Crise and the follow up La Pensée européenne au XVIIIème siècle, de Montesquieu à Lessing (1946), focusing on the intellectual history of the enlightenment (NYRB). The book seems to focus on the naissant conflict between Enlightenment values and their predecessors. \"One day, the French people, almost to a man, were thinking like Bossuet. The day after, they were thinking like Voltaire. No ordinary swing of the pedulum, that. It was a revolution\" (Hazard, XV). In the first chapter Hazard highlights the transformative effect that travel had on the beliefs of Europeans at this time: \"They arrived, these apostles from distant lands with their strange beliefs and customs, their laws, their own peculiar sense of values. They made a deep impression on a Europe only too eager to question them on their history and their religion\" (Hazard, 12). This continued contact via travel Hazard argues is the beginning of a revolution in the European understanding of not only European civilization, but civilization as a whole. \"The upshot of it all was that any man, however narrow and unimaginative, must have had it borne in upon him from his narrative that far away in distant Asia there were human beings in no way inferior to himself, however widely their mode of life might differ from his own. The notion of 'superiority' on which he had hitherto been brought up, as it were, was no longer valid. Henceforth he must think in other terms. 'Difference' not 'superiority' was the appropriate word; a striking psychological readjustment. Yes, in Persia everything is different... Now, these Persians are not barbarians\" (Hazard, 19). "

              "text": "\"La Crise de Conscience de L'Africain occidentalisé??\" draws a parallel between Hazard's work and possible works of Kodjo (or Vieyra). Rather than reorienting one's understanding of the world and foreigners from inferior to equal, perhaps Vieyra here is arguing for the reverse, that the approaching end of colonization demands a reevaluation of the self rather than foreigners in light of the end of a system which cast the colonized as inferiors. Vieyra here may be hinting here the need for a revolution in thought just akin to how the Enlightenment revolutionized European thought. Kodjo in some ways also parallels the travellers mentioned by Hazard, as a West African student presumably studying in France."

His directorial debut was with C'était il ya quatre ans (1954), a course conclusion\nwork presented at the Institut des hautes études cinématographiques (created in 1943, now École nationale supérieure des métiers\nde l'image et du son – La Fémis ), where he had been admitted in 1952, becoming the first African student to graduate from the\ninstitution. In metropolitan exile, Vieyra also directed the best-known Afrique sur Seine (1955), co-directed with Mamadou Sarr and in\ncollaboration with Jacques Mélo Kane and Robert Caristan, from Groupe Africain du Cinéma. According to Bamba (2008, p. 219), this\nfilm “marks the great turning point in the anti-colonialist conquest”, since, if “[t]he cinematic experience in Africa begins with the colonial\nperiod, […] the history of African cinema is far from being confused with colonial cinema”, and its beginnings tend to be associated\nwith “[f]ilms made by Africans and which thus break with the tradition of colonial propaganda films” (Bamba, 2008, p. 218). This is\nwhat defines, at least in part, the “turn” of Afrique sur Seine, which elaborates a black African perspective on Paris, understood as the\n“capital of black Africa”, in the terms of the film, which seeks there for evidence of encounters and relations between Africans and\nEuropeans in terms different from those that define colonial dynamics.\n\""

However, he is dressed in Western-style clothing, including socks with sandals. The sandals, in particular, trip him as he tries to externalize his mental space; this indicates the impossibility of blending these spaces, though they are existing alongside one another inevitably in Kodjo's life. Vieyra is able to construct this sense of cultural proximity yet separation through his use of mise-en-scène, which help to make concrete the internal struggle that Kodjo faces for the specifically European audience of his film. For example,  Vieyra's juxtaposition of the bare, dancing feet of the flashback sequence in Africa, this moment where his socked and sandaled feet constrain him, and Beck's tugging on his sock with a hole in it, combine to render visible the impossible task of living out either a wholly African or European present"

Following the flashback sequence, where Kodjo is dancing emphatically and in great physical proximity to a young African woman, Beck's arrival is Kodjo's next opportunity for human closeness. He picks Beck up and twirls her around, which she reprimands in the interest of protecting her records from damage. Rather than reflecting physical, human contact and proximity, Beck privileges retraint and deference: the safety of her records prevails over the warmth of Kodjo's embrace. Once she puts the records down, they merely rub noses, which does not quite match the original physicality of Kodjo's embrace. Even as they lay down together at the end of the film, indeed a moment of closeness, she joins him rather rigidly, laying next to him with little movement, punctuated by the classic, highly controlled sounds of the Beethoven record"

Because it was not feasible (in terms of budget, time, or legality, per the Laval Decree still in force) to actually film this sequence in Africa, the flashback is filmed on a soundstage that approximates the character's African homeland. In a technical sense, as well, this impossibility is highlighted by the issue of synchronizing the sound with the image of the sequence, as the drumming and singing heard does not correspond with the movements of the African characters shown. In trying to represent this marking moment of Africanness for Kodjo, Vieyra is blocked through technical limitations and colonial ones, despite his apparent original concept of making the African sequence even sound as if it were actually outside, contrasting with the other, indoor sequences' sound, according to notes preserved in the Vieyra archives at Indiana University's Black Film Center & Archive. All of this is besides the fact that the pan-African positioning of the film would likely be most convincing to its European main audience, generally unable to recognize or understand the precise provenance of the singing or dancing depicted in this sequence. This underscores that the kinds of African and European identities represented in the film exist in relation to one another rather than in fixity among the depiction of intersecting, patchwork space through the film more generally"

Within the world of the film, Kodjo's decoration of the room is the manifestation of a patchwork environment, including objects that render visible an Africanness within a European space more largely with them necessarily blending but existing alongside one another. By including these elements of the decor, it is one way that Vieyra suggests Kodjo's ties to Africa and make legible his partial sense of cultural distance from his receiving country for the primarily European audience. In other words, Vieyra uses the physical juxtaposition of European and African-coded elements to mirror an internal disposition of patchworking, wherein elements of European culture exist alongside African culture for Kodjo, leading to the \"crise de conscience de l'African occidentalisé??\" that Kodjo references in his school notes"

Kodjo is in the room, although zoom demonstrates that he is not truly present. As the camera zooms on Kodjo in his nostalgia, it is possible that the loss of focus is not intentional; however, when Kodjo first hears the drums of his flashback, he teeters in and out of focus as well, stylistically signaling the passage from one area of his internal 'patchwork' to the next"

Beck is shown in the foreground with her records and player in complete focus. In contrast, the background remains out of focus and contains Kodjo alongside several symbols pointing towards him being African (including the animal skins and the sculpture), creating for the viewer a physical manifestation of this patchwork space, where Beck and Kodjo exist together alongside Beethoven and African-signifying decor. Indeed, as the camera tracks and pans to follow Beck approaching Kodjo to lay down with him, the camera noticeably moves upward to include the African statue in the first shot of them in bed together, foreshadowing the continued African aspect internal to Kodjo as the European tenor of the space heightens with the music"
